# Karl-Portfolio

Karl’s Portfolio is a creative, living gallery crafted with HTML and SCSS. Wander through playful project snapshots, experimental UI explorations, and thoughtful interactions—each piece a small design journey. The site pairs a minimalist, responsive layout with subtle details and animations to invite curiosity, spark ideas, and make connections. Built to be fast and easy to remix, it's perfect for collaborators, prospective teams, and anyone who loves elegant, hands-on front-end work.
