# Karl-Portfolio

Hi — I’m Karl. This portfolio brings together carefully chosen front‑end projects, design experiments, and small production demos to show how I think about UI, interaction, and code. The site is intentionally compact and fast: clear layouts, accessible markup, and subtle UI details that reflect a focus on craft and practicality.

Inside you'll find concise case snapshots, links to live demos and source, and short notes about the problems solved and lessons learned. Built to be easy to remix and extend, the project welcomes feedback and collaboration—whether you’re a hiring manager, a fellow designer-developer, or someone who likes elegant, hands-on front-end work.

About
- I build interfaces with semantic HTML, SCSS, and small, purposeful JavaScript when it adds meaning. I care about readability, accessibility, and making designs that are easy to iterate on.
- This portfolio is both a professional showcase and a personal sketchbook — you’ll find polished case snapshots alongside experiments and notes about what I learned.

Featured work
- Concise case snapshots with links to live demos and source.
- Short context: the problem, my approach, key technical choices, and one thing I’d do differently next time.

Technologies
- HTML5, SCSS, and small JavaScript for interactions
- Focus on progressive enhancement and accessibility

Why this portfolio
- Professional: clear case summaries, clean code, and performance-minded choices.
- Personal: short notes, design intentions, and a friendly voice that invites conversation.
- Remix-friendly: components and styles are small and easy to reuse or adapt.

Contributing & feedback
- I welcome feedback and collaboration. If you see something that could be improved, open an issue or drop a note.
