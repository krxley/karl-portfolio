# Karl-Portfolio

Karl’s Portfolio blends a professional, design-forward presentation with a warm, personal voice. It highlights selected front‑end projects, design experiments, and practical code demos built with semantic HTML and SCSS. The site favors clarity, accessibility, and fast load performance, using subtle interactions and intentional typography to make the work feel approachable and polished.

Inside you'll find concise case snapshots, links to live demos and source, and short notes about the problems solved and lessons learned. Built to be easy to remix and extend, the project welcomes feedback and collaboration—whether you’re a hiring manager, a fellow designer-developer, or someone who likes elegant, hands-on front-end work.
